            <h2>📚 The Classroom – Mawlynnong, Meghalaya</h2>
            <p>🌿 Famous as the ‘Cleanest Village in Asia,’-Mawlynnong is a paradise of waterfalls and lush greenery.</p>
            <p>A group of travelers visited a small school in Mawlynnong, where children had no access to storybooks. They spent a day teaching English, math, and storytelling under an ancient banyan tree. One traveler, an author, gifted colorful books. The children, who had never seen illustrated books before, were inspired to read and dream big. 🌟</p>

            <h3>Weaving Stories in the Desert – Kuldhara, Rajasthan</h3>
            <p>🌿 An abandoned village near Jaisalmer, Kuldhara has a rich but forgotten history.</p>
            <p>Kuldhara’s women once created intricate hand-embroidered textiles, but tourism was limited. घुमक्कड़ travelers, fascinated by their work, bought handmade fabrics and connected them with eco-fashion brands. Within months, Kuldhara’s women had orders from across India, reviving their craft and making them financially independent.</p>

            <p>Ramesh, a young man from Munsiyari, was about to migrate to a city for work. But then, tourists from घुमक्कड़ started arriving. Seeing an opportunity, he trained as a local guide, leading trekkers to Khaliya Top and narrating local folk tales. Today, he earns sustainably, supports his family, and has become an ambassador for his village.</p>
